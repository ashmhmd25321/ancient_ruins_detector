# Ancient Ruins Detector

The Ancient Ruins Detector is an Android app developed using Python, Android Studio, and the Sceneform library. The purpose of this app is to detect ancient temples, ruins, and statues in Sri Lanka using image recognition and augmented reality (AR) technologies.

## Features

- Image Recognition: The app uses image recognition algorithms to identify ancient temples, ruins, and statues within images captured by the device's camera.
- Augmented Reality (AR): Once a target object is recognized, the app overlays 3D models of the detected ruins or statues onto the real-world camera view, providing an immersive AR experience.
- Sceneform Library: The Sceneform library is utilized to render and display the 3D models in the app's AR view.
- User Interface: The app features a user-friendly interface that allows users to capture images, view the detected objects, and explore the AR scene.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The image recognition algorithms are developed using Python. These algorithms analyze the input images and detect ancient temples, ruins, and statues based on trained models or feature extraction techniques.
- Android Studio: The app's user interface and AR functionality are implemented using Android Studio, a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development.
- Sceneform Library: Sceneform is a high-level library for Android that simplifies the process of rendering 3D models in AR scenes. It provides a straightforward way to load, manipulate, and display 3D models in the app.
- Android Camera API: The Android Camera API is used to access and capture images from the device's camera.
- Android Permissions: The app utilizes Android permissions to request access to the camera, necessary for capturing images.
- Android UI Components: The app leverages various Android UI components, such as buttons, image views, and lists, to provide a user-friendly interface for capturing and displaying images.

## Installation and Usage

To use the Ancient Ruins Detector app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.

4. Grant the necessary camera permissions when prompted.

5. Capture an image using the app's camera interface.

6. Wait for the image recognition algorithms to process the captured image.

7. If any ancient ruins or statues are detected, the app will display the results and overlay corresponding 3D models on the real-world camera view.

## Resources and Dependencies

The Ancient Ruins Detector app relies on the following resources and dependencies:

- Python Libraries: The Python algorithms may utilize popular libraries for image processing and machine learning, such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. Please refer to the specific requirements and dependencies of the image recognition component.
- Sceneform: To incorporate the Sceneform library into your Android project, make sure to add the necessary dependencies and configurations. Consult the Sceneform documentation for instructions on setting up the library.
